#Know Your Rights
## You Have the Right to Have Your Miranda Rights Read to You
You have the right to have your Miranda Right said to you IF you will be interrogated or go into Police custody. It is recommended that you do not speak to the police until you have your attorney present.

###What are Miranda rights?
Your Miranda rights are rights you have to interact with law enforcement.
These rights must be translated to a language you can understand.
- You have the right to remain silent.

Do not speak to the police without your lawyer present.
If you  do not feel comfortable staying silent a good response would be “I’m going to decline to answer any questions”.
- Anything you say can and will  be used against you in a court of law.
- You have the right to an attorney.
- If you cannot afford  an attorney, one will be provided for you.

You will receive a lawyer if you can not afford one.

#You Have the Right To Refuse A Search
You have certain rights to refuse a search. By simply saying “I do not consent to any search” could prevent you from being searched. By asking  “Am I free to go?” you will know if you are being detained or not.

###Your Right To Refuse A Search By Car
If an immigration agent asks if they can search you, you have the right to say no. Agents do not have the right to search you or your belongings without your consent or probable cause.
When pulled over while in a vehicle stay calm. Remain polite, calm, respectful and do not make sudden movements.
When being pulled over, signal and pull over to the side or a safe area. Have windows rolled down, turn off the engine and keep hands on the steering wheel.
When an officer approaches it is best to ask the officer for permission to retrieve license and registration. For additional information click link https://westdunn.com/blog/https/defensewestdunncom

###Your Right To Refuse A Search On Foot
If you are on foot, do not walk away and do not fidget with anything in your pockets that might make the officer think you have a weapon or something suspicious.

# You Have the Right to Deny Access to Your Home without a Warrant
The 4th Amendment guarantees that an individual will be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. You have the right to refuse entry to your home unless officers have a search warrant or there is an emergency.
Unless officers have a search warrant or there is an emergency, you can say no to a search, tell the officers what room(s) they can and can't search, and take away your consent at any time.
Police officers are generally required to knock and announce their presence before entering a home for any purpose.
Just because an occupant does not hear the police, does not mean that the police failed to announce their presence.
Police are allowed to enter home without warrant if police have reason to believe that you have a dangerous weapon.
If officers do not have a warrant, request a business card with the officer's name, badge number, and the incident number.
An ICE administrative warrant (Form I-200,I-205) does not allow officers to enter a home without consent.
You can choose to open the door, but be calm. Opening the door does not give them permission to come inside, but it is safer to speak to ICE through the door.
If asked to enter home, you can refuse if a warrant is not issued, or if the warrant is not signed by the judge. You do not have to be let them in when asking to see the warrant. 
Warrant can be seen through the window or slipped in between the door.

### Additional Information Regarding Warrants
A search warrant is a written order, signed by a judge, directing a law enforcement officer to conduct a search of a person or property and seize property specified in the warrant.

Do not resist Police if they have a valid search warrant.
The warrant must have been filled out honestly and intentionally by a law enforcement officer.
It must be based on good information and show probable cause to search;
It must be signed by an unbiased judge;
It must state specifically what law enforcement will try to seize and where they intend to search for it.
By obtaining a search warrant, police officers have been given permission to disregard an individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy due to the possibility of evidence of a crime being found.
Ask  to see the warrant and verify.
When being issued a warrant an interpreter is supposed to be issued if needed.

# You Have the Right to Identify Yourself
Certain states require you to show Identification when a police officer reasonably suspects you of a crime. You still have the right to remain silent for all other questions aside from Identifying yourself.

If you’re over 18, carry your papers with you at all times. If you don’t have them, tell the officer that you want to remain silent, or that you want to consult a lawyer before answering any questions.
If officers do not have a warrant, request a business card with the officer's name, badge number, and the incident number.
Visit your local DMV in person/online to be able to obtain your Identification/driver's license.
Visit this website to be able to apply in person https://iafdb.travel.state.gov/

# You Have the Right to Record Police Interactions
First and foremost, understand that you do have a First Amendment right to videotape or photograph a police officer performing their duties in public. It's a Constitutional right, but the way states are 
going to implement that right is going to vary. But as a general rule, you do have a right to pull out your cell phone camera and videotape a cop.

The officer does NOT have a right to take or delete the pictures or videos on your cell phone. This would be an obstruction of justice and they'd be destroying evidence. They might do it, but there are a few that have have gotten into significant legal trouble for doing so.

You may want to start recording or taking pictures, but keep this in mind: You can't break any other laws in the context of filming an officer (like trespassing on private property), and you certainly can't obstruct police activity while filming a police officer.

When an officer tries to make you stop recording or taking pictures, many will argue that you are obstructing their work and that you are violating other laws. But they may just be saying that to get you to stop—you have to understand what the laws are and make sure 
you're out of their way as you're filming them.

Some states try to get tricky with the audio portion of a video. The federal statutes aren't as concerned about video as they are about audio, and it's the federal wiretapping statutes that get a lot of people in trouble. The way these laws are applied again vary greatly state to state.

But in general, if you're in the Northeast, you're OK to record an officer as long as you do it openly, and as long as the officer knows that you're recording him—if you're doing it in secret things can get a little bit hairy. In other regions, states have laws that will vary depending
on the consent statutes they have for wiretapping and eavesdropping.

# Your Rights On How To Deal With ICE
Under the U.S. Constitution there are certain rights  a person that lives in the United States has. This applies to all even if you are an undocumented alien.

If you are not a U.S. citizen and an immigration agent requests your immigration papers, you must show them if you have them with you.
It  is important to note that  ICE is NOT Police.
The 5th Amendment allows an individual to (“plead the 5th”) keep quiet and not say anything that might be self incriminating.
If you are arrested, remain silent and don’t sign anything until you speak to a lawyer.
An ICE administrative warrant (Form I-200,I-205) does not allow officers to enter a home without your consent.
You are not required to speak or answer questions to ICE agents unless they have a warrant signed by a Judge.
Do not open the door, instead ask the agent to slip the warrant under the door or show it on the window, so you can view it.
If arrested it is important to remain silent until you speak to a lawyer!
If ICE shows up at a workplace DO NOT Consent to any searches. ICE can enter areas open to the general public (dining area, parking lot, waiting room) of a business without permission. But that does not 
give ICE the authority to detain, question, or arrest anyone.

# You Have the Right To Obtain Citizenship
Anyone can become a naturalized citizen of the United States, as long as the individual meets certain requirements.

The first step to becoming a citizen of the United States is to meet certain requirements such as:
- persons must be at least 18 years of age
- Be a lawful permanent resident, which means you have a green card
- Have lived in the United States as a lawful green card holder for at least 5 years, etc.

Citizenship can be achieved through simply being born on United States territory.
Non-citizen who have served in the United States Military are able to apply to become a United state Citizen. However certain requirements may not apply to individuals such as residency and physical 
presence requirements.
Any child under 18 years of age whose current residence is outside the United States, but is legally present in the U.S., may be able to apply for U.S. citizenship, if one parent (or a qualifying 
grandparent) is a naturalized citizen and meets the physical presence requirements.
