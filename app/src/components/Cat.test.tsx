/*
    Key concepts: mock, stub, Async code testing

    CHECKPOINT: We discussed 'mocking' an object in Java, can you find the equivalent in this JS code? What library is responsible?
    CHECKPOINT: We discussed 'stubbing' a return value in Java, can you find the equivalent in this JS code? What library is responsible?
    CHECKPOINT: What does 'waitFor' do and why do we need it? (hint: Start by trying to find the documentation for it)
    CHECKPOINT: Can you think of a way to consolidate any redundancies in the tests?

    Topics to go over: jest.fn(), waitFor and waitForElementToBeRemoved, mock/stubbing in js vs. java
