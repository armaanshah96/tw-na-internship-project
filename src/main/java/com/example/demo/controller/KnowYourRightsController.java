public class KnowYourRightsController {
/*    CHALLENGE: (Armaan/Danie will let yall know when to start on this) Can you create an endpoint to get all KnowYourRights content?

        Criteria to meet:
        1. endpoint is available at "api/know-your-rights"
        2. The HTTP method used is GET
        3. Follow Controller-Service-Repository structure
        4. Return all KnowYourRights content from the existing `kyr` table in Heroku
        5. If you find you have extra time, try introducing tests. While normally we always test, tests are not the main goal of this activity

        Hints:
        1. Feel free to pattern-match from the Cat example if you don't know where to start (see: Follow CatController getAllCats method)
        2. You will need to create a separate class (and file) for KnowYourRights Service and Repository and Model
        3. Don't forget the Spring annotations!!! For example: @RestController at the top of a controller file to indicate
        to Springboot that this controller is intended to be part of our REST API

        Goal:
        - Applying what we've learned about application architecture and REST api to our project
        - Can you articulate what you figured out that you didn't know prior to this exercise?

        When we come back together (today or tomorrow depending on time):
        - Mob pair on this task using test driven development
        - We are going to rotate drivers and main navigator very frequently using "Code with Me"
